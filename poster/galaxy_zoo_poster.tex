%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position 
%%% towards an already declared box. So if you have a box attached to the 
%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be inbetween, you 
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle 
%%% box.

  \headerbox{Problem Statement}{name=contribution,column=0,row=0,span=2}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  Given the image of the galaxy, we need to predict probability that it belongs to one of the morphological 
  categories. Top left part of the poster shows examples from each category. On the left class 1.1 (Smooth Galaxy), in the middle is class 1.2 (Spiral Galaxy) and on the right is class 1.3 ( Star / Artifact).
  }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Data Description}{name=abstract,column=0,below=contribution}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   The label for the data-set comes from collaborative tagging effort by citizen in science survey, in which 40-50 people classified each image into one of the categories. The labels are averaged, so we have probability for each class instead of a single label. The data-set we choose for our project is sub-set of this, where in we only consider 3 categories. We are using 30789 in training set and 30789 in the test set. We use 5 fold cross validation for choosing among different features, models and hyper-parameters.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \headerbox{Feature Evaluation}{name=speed,column=2,row=0,span=2}{
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   We evaluate the feature by comparing RMSE on the best hyper-parameter setting of Random Forest Regression. The table below shows the RMSE values for both features.
   }

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \headerbox{Feature Description}{name=data,column=0,above=bottom,below=abstract}{
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \textbf{Histogram of Gradients (HoG) Features: } 
  We consider a $k \times k$ patch in the image, and calculate gradient vector for each pixel. Then we build histogram with n bins. Bins corresponds to $180/i$ angles where $i \in \{0, 1, 2, ... (n-1)\}$ and each bin contains sum of magnitudes of gradient vectors corresponding to those bins. We do this for all patches in the image and concatenate all the histogram vectors. Before calculating the HoG features, we crop the image by center $208 \times 208$ and re-size it down to $104 \times 104$. We apply image de-noising to remove the spurious gradients. The last step of de-noising is essential to get HoG features right. The image below shows HoG feature extraction for a sample image with de-noising:

 The image below shows HoG feature extraction for a sample image without de-noising:

   \headerbox{Model Evaluation}{name=tracking,column=2,span=2,below=speed,above=bottom}{
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  We found that, hand engineered perform better in our setting. So we evaluate, hand engineered features to choose between random forest regression and multi-task lasso regression. We show the training error and validation error for different setting of hyper-parameters.
